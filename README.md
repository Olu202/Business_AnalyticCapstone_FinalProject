**Project: Competitive Pricing and Customer Segmentation Analysis**

This Python script performs an exploratory analysis of LG product sales data, competitor (Samsung) pricing data, and customer data. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, pricing trends, and develop a basic pricing model for competitive advantage.

**Dependencies:**

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
joblib

**Data Exploration and Cleaning**

The script loads three CSV datasets: LG_dataset.csv, Competitor_Samsung.csv, and Customers.csv.
It cleans and prepares the data by:
Removing leading/trailing spaces from column names.
Converting price and sales columns to numeric format (handling commas).
Converting 'Date' columns to datetime format (handling potential errors).
Checking for missing values and handling them (dropping rows with missing values in this example).
Basic data exploration techniques are used:
Printing data types and column names to understand the structure.
Generating summary statistics for numerical data.
Plotting sales trends over time (if 'Date' and 'Sales' columns exist).
Plotting competitor pricing trends (if 'Date' and 'Price' columns exist in both datasets).
Visualizing customer purchase frequency distribution.

**Feature Engineering**

Categorical variables (like 'Segment') are encoded using OneHotEncoder.
Numerical features (price, sales, purchase frequency, average spend) are normalized using StandardScaler.
A new feature, 'Lagged_Price', is created by shifting the price data by one period to analyze the impact of past prices on current sales.

**Data Merging and Customer Segmentation**

The script merges the LG and competitor data based on the 'Date' column.
Customer data is then merged with the final merged data using a dummy 'Segment' column for consistency.
K-Means clustering is used to segment customers based on purchase frequency and average spend. The silhouette score is used to evaluate the clustering performance.
The clusters are visualized using a scatter plot with purchase frequency on the x-axis and average spend on the y-axis.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

A linear regression model is trained to predict sales based on LG price, lagged LG price, and competitor (Samsung) price.
The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R^2).
The trained linear regression model and the KMeans clustering model are saved using joblib for future use.

**Additional Analysis**

The script generates a 'requirements.txt' file listing the required Python libraries.
It also plots a visualization of actual vs. predicted sales for comparison.

**Future Considerations**

This script provides a basic framework for analyzing pricing and customer segmentation.
More advanced techniques like time series analysis or recommendation systems could be explored.
Feature importance analysis can be performed on the linear regression model to understand the relative impact of each feature on sales prediction.
The model can be further improved by incorporating additional features or using more sophisticated machine learning algorithms.

**How to Use This Script**

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (pip install -r requirements.txt).
Replace the file paths for LG_dataset.csv, Competitor_Samsung.csv, and Customers.csv with the actual locations of your data files.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
The script will generate various plots and print evaluation metrics. The trained models will be saved as 'linear_model.pkl' and 'kmeans_model.pkl'.
